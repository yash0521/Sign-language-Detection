# Sign-language-Detection

Control presentation slides by using hand movements, like changing slide forward and backward, zoom in and out,
rotate etc.
•Designed gestures by capturing actions and applying time series machine learning algorithms for accurate recognition.
•Utilized OpenCV for real-time video capture and image processing to ensure smooth and responsive control.
•Integrated machine learning models for hand detection and gesture recognition. Employed Python for backend logic
and overall implementation.
